Reason why? It's because when you buy it, you know first thing that you will not lose any aspect_term for that laptop, the aspect_term will stay the same for the next year, and even if Apple does decides to change mode, your laptop aspect_term will only drop 10-20%, unlike PC laptops which drop more than 80%.
